        <h3>The Historic <br> Cemetery on the Hill</h3>
        <p>Situated in beautiful Old Noarlunga and perched on top of a hill overlooking the Onkaparinga River, the
          Church and Cemetery of St Philip and St James was established in 1850 shortly after the early European
          settlement in the area around the 1840's.</p>
        <p>On July 25th 1850, the land was conveyed in trust for erection and maintenance of a Church of England Church;
          the trustees being Richard Bosworth, James Clark, and Philip Hollins. The church eventually being named St
          Philip & St James for Mssrs Clark and Hollins. Mr Bosworth himself is buried in the cemetery.</p>
        <p>The Bacchus Family are honoured to have your loved one placed in their care and are pleased to offer both
          burial and ashes interments in The Cemetery on the Hill.</p>
